GitHub Tutorial | How To Setup And Use Github
About Me,
Not many have a story like mine. At 2 years old I was diagnosed with leukemia and went into chemotherapy. This brings a great many problems, not least among them a compromised immune system. I caught a cold that turned into pneumonia and I died. It didn’t stick. In that time I saw things that would influence my life profoundly. I can’t explain what happened but when I woke up, the pneumonia was gone along with the leukemia. I have also overcome Pancreatic Cancer, Crohn's Disease, and Diabetes just to name a few of the hurdles I found myself lifted over. I give all glory to God, but I tell you these things not to garner sympathy or convince you that my God is real. I tell you this because I believe all these things made me a purposeful person. I got a certification in Computer programming on purpose. I write clean code on purpose. I believe you are reading this on purpose. Let me show you what I can do for you on purpose.
